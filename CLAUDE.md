## What Tractify Is
A full-stack auto-booking platform for Jose's lead generation business. The model: Jose runs niche lead gen sites (starting with OilToHeatRebate.com for Seattle oil-to-heat-pump conversions), sells those leads to HVAC contractors, and uses Tractify to automatically match leads to contractors and handle appointment booking — no manual scheduling needed.

**The full lead flow:**
1. Homeowner fills out quiz on OilToHeatRebate.com (or future niche sites)
2. Google Apps Script saves lead to Google Sheet + sends owner email + sends homeowner confirmation
3. Apps Script bridge POSTs lead to Tractify's `/api/leads/inbound` endpoint *(currently dormant — see Bridge section)*
4. Tractify auto-matches lead to the right contractor by niche + zip code (round-robin rotation)
5. Homeowner gets email with personalized booking link (48hr expiry)
6. Homeowner picks time from contractor's live availability calendar
7. Appointment confirmed — both parties notified, synced to Google Calendar

**Business model:** Sell raw leads first (no Tractify needed), then upgrade contractors to booked leads via Tractify (much higher value product).

## Database Schema
All tables are PostgreSQL. Schema auto-initializes on boot via `db.js`. Additional columns added by startup migrations in `server.js` (safe to re-run — uses `IF NOT EXISTS`).

### Core Tables

**`admins`** — admin accounts (id, email, password_hash, name, created_at)

**`niches`** — service categories. Auto-seeded on first boot: Roofing, Plumbing, HVAC, Electrical, Landscaping, Painting, General Contracting

**`contractors`**
```
id, email, password_hash, name, phone, company_name,
niche_id, service_zip_codes (TEXT — JSON array ["98101"] or ["*"]),
status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',   ← pending | approved | declined
service_radius_miles INTEGER,
max_appointments_per_day INTEGER,
is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
applied_at, declined_at,
google_refresh_token, google_calendar_id,
reset_token TEXT,                ← for forgot-password flow
reset_token_expires TIMESTAMPTZ,
created_at
```

**`leads`**
```
id, name, email, phone, niche_id, zip_code, description,
status TEXT DEFAULT 'new',       ← new | matched | booked | completed | cancelled
assigned_contractor_id,
source_site, external_tier, external_score,
metadata JSONB,                  ← stores qualifying fields from external sites
created_at
```

**`appointments`**
```
id, lead_id (nullable — NULL = external block), contractor_id,
scheduled_date, scheduled_time, duration_minutes DEFAULT 60,
status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',   ← pending | confirmed | cancelled | completed
google_event_id, notes, created_at, updated_at
```
Partial unique index prevents double-booking (excludes cancelled rows).

**`availability_slots`** — weekly recurring schedule (contractor_id, day_of_week 0-6, start_time, end_time, is_active)

**`availability_overrides`** — date-specific blocks or custom hours (contractor_id, date, is_available, start_time, end_time, reason)

**`booking_tokens`** — UUID tokens (48hr expiry) for homeowner booking links. Has `source` field (`'booking'` or `'reschedule'`) and `abuse_count` for reschedule abuse prevention.

**`round_robin_state`** — tracks last assigned contractor per niche + zip for fair rotation

**`lead_events`** — full audit trail. Every status change, email send, match attempt, etc. (lead_id, event_type, payload JSONB, created_at)

**`inbound_api_keys`** — per-site API keys for inbound lead submissions (id, name, key TEXT plaintext, source_slug, is_active, created_at, last_used_at, contractor_id TEXT → contractors.id, allowed_origins TEXT)
- `contractor_id` is optional. When set, inbound leads from that key skip the matching engine entirely and are assigned directly to that contractor (status set to `matched` immediately). When null, normal round-robin matching runs.
- `allowed_origins` is optional. Comma-separated list of allowed domains (e.g. `https://clientsite.com, https://www.clientsite.com`). When set, the inbound endpoint rejects requests whose `Origin` header doesn't match — prevents API key theft. Leave blank to allow any origin (backward compatible).

**`intake_events`** — client onboarding intake form step tracking (id, type, step INTEGER, step_name TEXT, direction TEXT, client_id TEXT, business_name TEXT, ts TIMESTAMPTZ, created_at)
- Fired from the client intake form HTML on every Next/Back click
- `direction`: `start` (form opened) | `forward` (Next clicked) | `back` (Back clicked)
- `client_id`: browser session ID generated once on form load
- Powers the intake funnel stats endpoint for dropoff analysis

## Contractor Flow (Self-Signup)
Contractors can apply themselves at `/apply`:
1. Fill out form: name, email, password, phone, company, niche, service zips, radius
2. Gets acknowledgment email, admin gets alert email
3. Admin reviews in dashboard → Contractors tab → pending applications shown with Approve/Decline buttons
4. On approve: `is_active` set to 1, contractor gets approval email, can now log in
5. On decline: contractor gets decline email, admin can delete the application record
6. Approval uses `is_active` (not a `status` column) — the `status` column exists but approve/decline only uses `is_active`

---

## Forgot Password Flow
1. Contractor goes to `/forgot-password`, enters email
2. Backend checks `is_active = 1` (must be an approved/active contractor)
3. Generates `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')` token, stores with 1hr expiry
4. Sends email with link to `/reset-password?token=...`
5. Reset page validates token + expiry, lets user set new password (min 8 chars)
6. On success: token cleared, password bcrypt-hashed and saved
7. Always returns 200 on forgot-password (prevents email enumeration)

---

## Password Visibility Toggle
All password fields across the app have an Eye/EyeOff toggle button:
- LoginPage.jsx (sign in)
- ContractorApply.jsx (password + confirm)
- ResetPassword.jsx (new password + confirm)
- ContractorPortal.jsx — Change Password section (current, new, confirm)
- AdminDashboard.jsx — Add Contractor form (temporary password)

---

## Homeowner Self-Service Cancel/Reschedule
- Cancel/reschedule tokens stored in `booking_tokens` with `source` field
- Homeowners get cancel + reschedule links in confirmation emails
- `/cancel` route + `CancelPage.jsx` handles both flows
- Reschedule abuse prevention: checks `abuse_count` before cancelling existing appointment
- On reschedule: new booking token issued, contractor gets `sendRescheduledNotification` email

---

## Matching Engine (matchingEngine.js)
- Matches by niche_id + zip code
- Supports `["*"]` zip code (serves all zips)
- Radius-based: also matches contractors whose `service_zip_codes` are within `service_radius_miles` of the lead's zip
- Round-robin rotation via `round_robin_state` table
- Enforces `max_appointments_per_day` per contractor
- Lead deduplication: same email + niche within 30 days = no new lead created

---

## Admin Dashboard Features
Tabs: Leads | Contractors | Appointments | Performance | API Keys | Niches

**Leads tab:** Full lead list with status badges, search, manual match trigger, resend booking link, reassign contractor, delete

**Contractors tab:**
- Active contractors list with niche, zip codes, activity status
- "Add Contractor" form (admin-created accounts with temp password)
- Pending applications section with Approve/Decline buttons
- Declined applications with Delete option

**Appointments tab:**
- Full appointment list with lead info, contractor, date/time, status
- Cancel button (all statuses)
- Delete button (cancelled/completed only — with confirm step)

**Performance tab:** Lead conversion rates, contractor stats, booking funnel metrics

**API Keys tab:** Create/manage per-site API keys for external lead sources. Each key can optionally be linked to a specific contractor — when linked, all leads from that site route directly to that contractor, bypassing the shared matching engine. Each key also supports an optional allowed_origins field (comma-separated domains) to restrict which websites can use the key. Used for the HVAC website bundle business model.

**Niches tab:** Add/edit/delete service niches

---

## ContractorPortal Features
- Google Calendar-inspired weekly view with day columns
- Stats bar: This Week / Total / Upcoming counts
- Blocked days shown with red diagonal stripe overlay
- Date override picker: month + day inputs, smart year auto-detection
- Custom `TimeSelect` component (styled dropdown, 4AM–10PM, 30-min increments)
- Manual time blocking (external blocks with null lead_id)
- Google Calendar sync button (OAuth flow)
- Profile editing: name, phone, company
- Settings: service radius, max appointments per day
- Change Password section (current + new + confirm, all with eye toggle)
- Availability fetch range: 365 days
- Logout button in mobile bottom nav

---

## Mobile Responsiveness (fully complete as of June 19, 2026)
All pages are fully responsive. Key fixes applied:

**`frontend/index.html`** — `shrink-to-fit=no` in viewport meta prevents Safari from auto-scaling the page when content is slightly wider than the viewport.

**`frontend/src/index.css`** — overflow rules are placed OUTSIDE `@layer` (highest cascade priority, cannot be overridden by Tailwind). `overflow-x: hidden` on `html`, `body`, and `#root`. All `input`, `select`, `textarea` forced to `font-size: 16px !important` to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom on focus. The `.input` component class uses `text-base` (16px).

**`AdminDashboard.jsx`** — all mobile card views use `truncate` + `min-w-0` on long text (emails, names, company info). Main content div uses `md:ml-56 min-w-0 overflow-x-hidden` (NOT `w-full` — adding `w-full` with `ml-56` causes the div to extend past the viewport). All desktop table wrappers use `overflow-x-auto` (not `overflow-hidden`) so wide tables scroll rather than clip.

**`ContractorPortal.jsx`** — Block Time form stacks vertically on mobile. TimeSelect widths reduced. All tab content containers have `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` (prevents implicit horizontal scroll). AppointmentCard text truncated.

**Key CSS gotchas for future work:**
- `overflow-x: clip` is NOT supported on iOS < 15.4 — always use `overflow-x: hidden` on root elements
- Setting `overflow-y: auto` implicitly sets `overflow-x: auto` per CSS spec — always pair with explicit `overflow-x: hidden`
- `@layer base` rules have lower cascade priority than non-layered CSS — put critical rules outside any `@layer`
- Long text without `truncate` + `min-w-0` in flex containers genuinely widens layout past the viewport, bypassing any CSS overflow setting

## The Bridge (OilToHeatRebate.com → Tractify)
Automatically sends leads from the quiz site into Tractify's matching engine.

**Current status: DORMANT (intentionally)** — no contractors onboarded yet.

**How to flip it ON when ready:**
1. Go to script.google.com → open Apps Script for OilToHeatRebate.com
2. Click gear → Project Settings → Script Properties → Add:
   - `PROBOOK_API_URL` = `https://probookhq.com`
   - `PROBOOK_API_KEY` = *(the value of `INBOUND_API_KEY` in Railway)*
3. Deploy → Manage Deployments → new version

No code changes needed — everything is already built and waiting.

---

## OilToHeatRebate.com (The Lead Gen Site)
- **URL:** oiltoheatrebate.com — hosted on Cloudflare Pages
- **What it does:** Seattle oil-heat homeowner quiz (13 steps)
- **Backend:** Google Apps Script → saves to Google Sheet + sends emails
- **Lead scoring:** Tier 1 ≥12pts, Tier 2 ≥7pts, Tier 3 lower
- **Bot protection:** Cloudflare Turnstile
- **Current script:** `NewScript.js` in `~/Desktop/lead-booking-app/`

---

## How to Push Changes to Railway
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/lead-booking-app
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/HEAD.lock   # clear lock files if needed
git add -A
git commit -m 'Your message'           # use single quotes — zsh expands ! in double quotes
git push origin main
```
Railway auto-deploys within ~2 minutes of the push.

**Note:** The sandbox (Claude's shell) cannot push to GitHub via HTTPS. Always push from Jose's terminal.

**If Railway does not auto-deploy after a successful push:**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m 'Trigger Railway redeploy'
git push origin main
```

---

## How to Run Locally
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/lead-booking-app
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:4000. If `backend/node_modules` is missing:
```bash
npm install --prefix backend
npm install --prefix frontend
npm run --prefix frontend build
npm start
```

---

## nixpacks.toml (Railway Build Config)
```toml
[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "cd backend && npm install",
  "cd frontend && npm install"
]
[phases.build]
cmds = ["cd frontend && npm run build"]
[start]
cmd = "node backend/server.js"
```
This replaced the Dockerfile. Railway uses this automatically.

---

## Startup Migrations (server.js)
On every boot, `server.js` runs these safe migrations before accepting requests:
```javascript
await db.query(`ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reset_token TEXT`);
await db.query(`ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reset_token_expires TIMESTAMPTZ`);
await db.query(`ALTER TABLE contractors ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'`);
await db.query(`UPDATE contractors SET status = 'approved' WHERE is_active = 1 AND status IS NULL`);
await db.query(`ALTER TABLE inbound_api_keys ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS contractor_id TEXT REFERENCES contractors(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`);
await db.query(`ALTER TABLE inbound_api_keys ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS allowed_origins TEXT`);
await db.query(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS intake_events (...)`);
```
Note: `contractor_id` must be TEXT (not INTEGER) because `contractors.id` is a UUID stored as TEXT.

---

## Common Issues and Fixes

**Git lock files blocking push**
→ `rm -f .git/index.lock .git/HEAD.lock` then retry

**zsh "event not found" on git commit**
→ zsh expands `!` in double-quoted strings. Use single quotes: `git commit -m 'Your message'`

**"Cannot GET /" on Railway**
→ Check `nixpacks.toml` exists in repo root. Frontend must be built. Express catch-all serves `frontend/dist/index.html`.

**"No contractors available" when submitting lead**
→ No active contractors. Go to /admin → Contractors and add one with matching niche and zip codes.

**Booking email not arriving**
→ Check Resend dashboard. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` and `FROM_EMAIL` are set in Railway.

**Admin locked out**
→ Use the curl register command above (only works if no admin exists in DB).

**Forgot password email not arriving**
→ Contractor must have `is_active = 1` in DB. Check Railway logs for `[FORGOT-PW]` entries.

**column "status" does not exist error**
→ Startup migration adds this. Should never happen on a live deploy.

**iOS Safari auto-zooms on input focus**
→ Safari zooms when input `font-size < 16px`. Fixed globally in `index.css`. If it recurs, verify the `font-size: 16px !important` rule is present outside any `@layer`.

**Mobile horizontal scroll**
→ Two root causes: (1) overflow rules in `@layer` can be overridden — rules must be outside any layer. (2) Long text without `truncate` + `min-w-0` genuinely widens layout. Both must be fixed together.

**Contractor can't block same-day time slots**
→ Root cause: `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` parses the string as UTC midnight, making today look like yesterday in Pacific time. Fixed by constructing the date as `new Date(year, month, day)` (local time) and never re-parsing the formatted string.

**API key rejected with 403 "Origin not allowed"**
→ The key has `allowed_origins` set. Add your domain to the allowed list in Admin → API Keys, or clear the field to allow any origin.

---

## Launch Status (as of July 4, 2026)
The app is fully built, deployed, and tested. All features complete including dedicated contractor routing, domain-restricted API keys, and intake form tracking. Fully mobile-responsive.

**Completed since launch:**
- ✅ Railway credit card added
- ✅ Dedicated contractor routing via API keys (June 23) — each HVAC client's website routes leads exclusively to their contractor, bypassing the shared matching engine
- ✅ Admin dashboard overflow fix — desktop tables scroll correctly on all tabs
- ✅ Domain-restricted API keys (June 28) — `allowed_origins` field on inbound_api_keys prevents API key theft by rejecting requests from non-whitelisted domains
- ✅ Same-day time block fix (June 28) — contractors can now block time slots for the current day; was broken by a UTC timezone parsing bug in ContractorPortal.jsx
- ✅ Intake form step tracking (June 28) — `/api/intake/track` endpoint + `intake_events` table lets the HVAC client intake form fire step events so Jose can see dropoff rates per form step
- ✅ Full rebrand to Tractify (July 4) — renamed from ProBook → ProAppt → Tractify across entire codebase; tractifyhq.com bought, added to Cloudflare, Resend domain verified via Cloudflare auto-configure, Railway custom domain updated, all env vars updated (BRAND_NAME, FROM_EMAIL, FRONTEND_URL)

**Remaining operational items (not code):**
- [ ] Run full end-to-end test with a real contractor before onboarding clients
- [ ] Flip bridge ON once first contractor is onboarded (see Bridge section — no code changes needed)
- [ ] Google Calendar credentials (deferred — add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` to Railway when ready)
- [ ] Wire JS fetch snippet into intake form HTML on each step's Next/Back button click (intake form already fires to `/api/intake/track` — verify it's working)
- [ ] Build intake funnel view in Tractify admin dashboard (data is being collected, UI not yet built)

## ⚠️ Client Go-Live Checklist (HVAC Website Bundle)
**Run through this every single time you onboard a new HVAC client. Do not skip steps.**

1. [ ] Create contractor account in Tractify admin → Contractors → Add Contractor
2. [ ] Create API key in Tractify admin → API Keys → New Key
   - Name: client's business name (e.g. "Premier Comfort HVAC")
   - Source slug: their domain slug (e.g. "premiercomforthvac")
   - Link to their contractor account
   - **⚠️ ALWAYS set `Allowed Origins` to their deployed domain** (e.g. `https://premiercomforthvac.com, https://www.premiercomforthvac.com`)
   - **If you forget `allowed_origins`, anyone who finds the API key can flood Tractify with fake leads from any website**
3. [ ] Copy the generated API key — it's only shown once
4. [ ] Paste the CLIENT config (from intake form Worker submission) into the HVAC template `index.html`
5. [ ] Replace `YOUR_PROBOOK_API_KEY` in the CLIENT config with the real key from step 3
6. [ ] Update `CLIENT.sourceSite` and `CLIENT.siteUrl` to the client's actual domain
7. [ ] Swap in client's logo, cover photo (from R2 bucket if uploaded via intake form)
8. [ ] Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (or client's host)
9. [ ] Verify the deployed domain matches what you set in `allowed_origins` — test a lead submission
10. [ ] Have contractor log into Tractify portal and set their weekly availability
11. [ ] Send contractor their Tractify portal login

## Scaling Plan
- **New niches:** Add contractors under different niches — matching engine handles routing automatically
- **New cities:** Add contractors with their service zip codes
- **New lead gen sites:** Each site gets its own `PROBOOK_NICHE` and `PROBOOK_SOURCE` in its Apps Script
- **SMS:** Add Twilio to `notifications.js` for text alerts to contractors
- **Payments:** Add Stripe to charge contractors per lead or monthly subscription
